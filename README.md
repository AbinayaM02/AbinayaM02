### Vanakkam Makkale 🙏

I'm Abinaya Mahendiran, currently working as a Manager (Data Science & Applied AI) at NEXT Labs, Mphasis.

- 🔭 I build end-to-end NLP and MLOps products.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source applied/research projects focusing on NLP. I'm also interested in teaching.
- 💬 Ask me about NLP/NLU, NLG, MLOps, and Architecting ML systems.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Other than coding, I love cooking (secretly aspiring to be a chef someday!) and gardening.
